Task: Multi-Axis Sales and Inventory Trend Analysis

 

Create a Chart.js visualization that combines multiple datasets to analyze the relationship between vehicle sales, inventory levels, and appointment rates for a USA automotive dealership over the past 12 months. The chart should include the following elements:

Primary Y-axis: Total monthly vehicle sales (new and used combined)
Secondary Y-axis: Inventory levels (new vehicles only)
X-axis: Months (December 2023 to November 2024)
Line chart: Monthly appointment set rates for new vehicles (as a percentage)
Bar chart: Monthly sales breakdown between new and used vehicles
Scatter plot: Appointment close rates for new vehicles
 

Requirements:

Implement the chart using Chart.js version 3.7 or later.
Configure the chart to use a stacked bar chart for new and used vehicle sales.
Set up three different y-axes for sales, inventory, and percentages.
Implement interactive tooltips that show all relevant data for each data point.
Add a legend that clearly distinguishes between the different datasets.
Implement responsive design to ensure the chart looks good on various screen sizes.
Add animations to make the chart more engaging when it loads or when data updates.
 

Optional:

Implement a date range selector to allow users to zoom in on specific time periods.
Add a trendline for the appointment set rate to show the overall trend.
Implement click events on the scatter plot points to show additional details about each month's appointment close rate.
